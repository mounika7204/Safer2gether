      <button class="accordion">Job offers</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Be cautious with job postings that seem too good to be true or lack essential details about the company or the job itself.
          Verify the legitimacy of the employer by researching the company, checking their website, and contacting them directly through official channels.
          Be wary of job offers that require upfront payments or sensitive personal information during the application process.
          Never share financial information or copies of identification documents unless you have thoroughly verified the employer's legitimacy.

      <button class="accordion">Lottery Scams</button>
      <div class="panel">

          Legitimate lotteries do not require winners to pay fees or taxes to claim their prizes.
          Do not share sensitive personal information or financial details with unknown or unverified parties.
          Be skeptical of any requests for upfront payments or wire transfers to claim a prize.

      <div class="panel">
        <p>Research the charity before making any donations. Verify its legitimacy, check its registration status, and read reviews or reports from independent sources.
          Be cautious of unsolicited emails, phone calls, or social media messages asking for donations.
          Verify the charity's contact information independently and avoid clicking on links in emails or messages that claim to be from charities.
          Do not give out personal or financial information to unknown charities or organizations.
          Be wary of high-pressure tactics or emotional appeals that aim to rush you into making a donation.

          Avoid sharing personal details such as your home address, social security number, or financial information.
