        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Fake shopping websites are scams that imitate real online stores to deceive people. They offer attractive deals, have poor website design, lack proper security measures, and provide limited contact information. Look for SSL certificates, verify domain names, and read reviews from multiple sources. Use secure payment methods and be cautious with personal information. Report suspicious websites to protect others from fraud..</p>
